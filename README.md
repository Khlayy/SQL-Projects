# Welcome to my SQL Projects Repository!

## Description 
This is a collection of my SQL Personal Projects. These projects represent the milestones of my progress in my SQL learning journey. Each script and query reflects my growing understanding and proficiency in working with data. Since starting learning SQL in February 2024, I've been deeply engaged in the world of databases and SQL commands, and I'm thoroughly enjoying the learning process. Feel free to explore the projects, dive into the code, and embark on your own SQL learning adventure alongside me!

## Business Understanding
I selected datasets with varying complexities to enhance my SQL and data analytics skills.

## Data Understanding
Most of the datasets I worked on these projects relates to my passion and profession. As a chemical engineer and a Ghibli fan, I worked on US EPA's SCIL and Studio Ghibli datasets and performed data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), refining my skills and expanding my capabilities in SQL.
