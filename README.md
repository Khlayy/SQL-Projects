# Welcome to my SQL Projects Repository!
Here, you'll find a collection of SQL scripts, queries, and databases that I've crafted during my SQL learning journey. Since starting my SQL journey in February 2024, I've been deeply engaged in the world of databases and data manipulation, and I'm thoroughly enjoying the learning process.

These projects represent the milestones of my progress in SQL. Each script and query reflects my growing understanding and proficiency in working with data. Throughout this journey, I've explored various techniques such as data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), refining my skills and expanding my capabilities in SQL.

I'm delighted to share what I've learned and accomplished thus far, and I'm filled with excitement for the future possibilities that SQL holds for me.

Feel free to explore the projects, dive into the code, and embark on your own SQL learning adventure alongside me!
